# **Abstract**
Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells represent a promising clean energy technology that converts hydrogen and oxygen into electricity with water as the sole byproduct. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of the impact of flow direction, such as parallel flow and counter-flow configurations, on the performance of a single-channel serpentine geometry. The serpentine flow field pattern is widely used because it enhances mass transport and reduces pressure drop. This study integrates computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using an open-source toolbox based on C++ to investigate the influence of flow direction on the liquid water saturation distribution within the cell. The analysis of liquid water accumulation is essential, as it directly affects the overall performance and durability of the PEM fuel cell. Saturation contour maps are obtained at 0.52 V for each geometry. The results show that water saturation tends to accumulate at the edges of the electrode-membrane assembly, and the counter-parallel flow exhibits the major saturation distribution. (pages 60-66)
